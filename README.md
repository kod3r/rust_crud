A demonstration of how a Rust application connected to a Postgres database at the back end can be designed to build  basic CRUD
(Create Record Update Delete) to both persist and modify data from an accesible frontend.

The goal mostly is to demonstrate how well Rust can work with a Postgres or any othe type of database.
